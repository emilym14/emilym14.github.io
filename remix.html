									<h4>10 Quotations</h4>

<p><i><b>Via Free Culture:</b> "The aim of any literacy, and this literacy in particular, is to empower people to choose the appropriate language for what they need to create or express. It is to enable students to communicate in the language of the twenty-first century."</i></p>
<p><i><b>Via VT-shaped Student:</b> "We want to prepare students who can tackle the complex global problems and opportunities of the future, said President Tim Sands. To do that, students need to be adaptable, resilient, and culturally competent, seeing the world through the lens of empathy and our universitys motto, Ut Prosim (That I May Serve)."</i></p>

<h5>Via New program to highlight enrichment opportunities for students:</h5>
<blockquote>"The new program’s integrated approach will offer a framework for helping students explore their options creatively, to realize their full potential ... "</blockquote>

<p><i><b>Via VT-shaped Discovery:</b> "A Virginia Tech education will engage the whole person and through inclusive connections contribute to the value of each person and to the groups in which they participate."</i></p>
<p><i><b>Via Liberal Arts education and the VT-shaped Learner:</b> "Liberal education involves being able to balance a free range of inquiry alongside the needs and obligations of the community. It is this interplay between inquiry and service that defines Virginia Tech’s Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) model."</i></p>

<h5>Via VT-shaped Discovery:</h5>
<blockquote><q>"Experiential learning wrapped around an issue, problem, or topic of the community will become the core of the educational experience, with the traditional course instruction supporting that work."
  </q></blockquote>

<p><i><b>Via New program to highlight enrichment opportunities for students:</b> "To create these kinds of learners, it may be useful to remember that, alongside invention, we need to find both inspiration and imagination, she wrote. The greatest of land-grant institutions continue to integrate practical and liberal education, and they do so because technology never works without people as part of the equation, because innovation is fundamentally a human pursuit."</i></p>
<p><i><b>Via Virginia Techs provost orchestrating change:</b> "The VT-shaped graduate will be well-rounded, both hirable and ready to serve the community, Rikakis said."</i></p>

<h5>Via VT-shaped student:</h5>
<blockquote><q>"The 'V' is achieved through a variety of intentional activities at Virginia Tech, including the curriculum itself through things like undergraduate research, a robust general education curriculum that allows for opportunities like internships and education abroad, and First Year Experiences courses to set students up for success from the beginning of their time here at Virginia Tech."

</blockquote>

<p><i><b>Via:Liberal arts education and the VT-shaped learner:</b>"The Renaissance is a good historical moment for us to remember because modern science was made possible when artisanal practices—ways of making, doing, and inventing that had the same energy and excitement that we now see in some of the Virginia Tech hackathons and maker’s camps—intersected with a different excitement that surrounded liberal education."</i></p>
