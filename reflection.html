								<h2>Exploring the VT-Shaped Student </h2>

								<h4> The T-Shaped Student: A Podcast </h4>

<iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/321666971&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

<h4> What is this podcast about? </h4>

<p> The T-shaped podcast was the second project assigned to us this semester in writing and digital media. For this assignment I worked in a group with two classmates to create an original play that served to illustrate the T-shaped student as we understood it. The vertical base of the T represents an established line of experience in one area, whereas the shorter, horizontal line on top of the T represents an interest in outside, complimentary areas of work and study. </p>

<p> In this podcast, we each contributed to the writing of the script and starred as one of the main characters in the storyline. This story is about Billy, a freshman engineering student who struggles when given an essay assignment; in order to improve, he seeks out help at the on-campus writing center and discovers he has an interest in English after all. </p>

<h4> The V-Shaped Student: A Video </h4>

<h4> What is this video about? </h4>

<p> The V-shaped video was the third project assigned to us this semester in writing and digital media. For this assignment I worked in the same group as I did for the previous assignment, the T-shaped podcast. My group created a video that served to depict our understanding of the V-shaped student; the V-shaped student is a student who invests in life outside the classroom at Virginia Tech in addition to his or her academia. This is demonstrated in a number of ways: internships, study abroad programs, research, organizations, clubs and more. </p>

<p> In our video, we each contributed to the writing of the script and starred as one of the main characters in the storyline. This story is about Jimmy, a freshman English student who is struggling to understand the internship-hunting process, as well as what it means to get involved outside of classes. </p>

<p> Here, Jimmy is encouraged by his roommate and a Red Cross recruiter to build a resume, dress the part and explore his passions and interests outside the classroom. </p>
