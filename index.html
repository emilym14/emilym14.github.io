								<h2>Introduction<br />
								</h2>
								<p> A little about me—I am an active and passionate storyteller, an avid coffee drinker, anti-Oxford comma and a student who fully embraces her multimedia journalist title. As one may presume, I love to write. In addition to writing, I foster a passion for film, as well as photography. I like to utilize those passions in a way that allows me to contribute to a bigger cause, to get involved with programs that work to help others and spread the love and hope I’ve found in Jesus.

<p> Now in my final year of college as a multimedia journalism and creative writing double major at Virginia Tech, I continue to seek out new methods of telling stories. Continually, I look to incorporate new mediums into the experience: photographs, film, audio, 360-degree video and interactive graphics.
<p/>

<p> My goal as a creative storyteller is to combine the knowledge I have of both technical journalism and boundary-pushing creative writing to construct innovative content for publications, to think outside the box and to bring multiple dimensions to the content I create.

								<h2>Goals<br />
								</h2>

<p> Over the past semester I’ve found myself transitioning into a new mindset—the life-after-college mindset. My goals have undergone a transformation, something I’ve had the opportunity to think through while participating in this course for writing and digital media. <p/>

<p> Long term, I would love to combine the hard-skills I’ve obtained in college (i.e. html and css coding, photography, film, 360-degree video, audio and video editing, etc.) with my passions for writing, working with people, storytelling—and of course, coffee—to start my own business. <p/>

<p> Ideally, I would love to found and build a brand for my own coffee shop. This would be a business that exists to invite people in and that creates a comfortable space for conversation, re-connection and storytelling. <p/>

<p> Partnering with a friend who has a background in business, I would love to use my creative passions to design an efficient, aesthetically pleasing flow to the shop, create a monthly newsletter, social media outlets where I can interact with the customers and establish our shop as a home-away-from-home in the community. <p/>

								<h2>Reflection<br />
								</h2>
								<p> Over the past semester in writing and digital media I’ve noticed a lot of growth; it’s been challenging, exciting—and honestly—very enjoyable. This was a course that pushed me to create in ways I had not yet considered, to step outside of my comfort zone and to embrace a technical craft that initially overwhelmed me (i.e. coding, html, css, etc.).  <p/>

<p> I believe Dr. Evia did an excellent job of creating a hospitable space in the classroom where students could ask questions, receive friendly challenge and grow comfortable with coding and creating html and css design. <p/>
	<p> At the beginning of this semester, I had little to no experience with coding. I had dabbled in html, but retained little to no skill in the area. The structure of this class allowed me to dabble, grow, return and reapply those hard-skills to multiple projects, which was something I personally enjoyed very much; it enable me to grow and retain these coding methods in a way that was progressive for my learning inside the classroom and my interests outside the classroom. <p/>

	<p> Now, I feel confident and motivated to design websites, add my own personal touch and challenge myself again to grow in these new, technical areas of writing. <p/>
