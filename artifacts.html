								<h4> The T-shaped Student: A Podcast </h4>

<iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/321666971&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

<h4> What is this podcast about? </h4>

<p> The T-shaped podcast was the second project assigned to us this semester in writing and digital media. For this assignment I worked in a group with two classmates to create an original play that served to illustrate the T-shaped student as we understood it. The vertical base of the T represents an established line of experience in one area, whereas the shorter, horizontal line on top of the T represents an interest in outside, complimentary areas of work and study. </p>

<p> In this podcast, we each contributed to the writing of the script and starred as one of the main characters in the storyline. This story is about Billy, a freshman engineering student who struggles when given an essay assignment; in order to improve, he seeks out help at the on-campus writing center and discovers he has an interest in English after all. </p>


<h4> The V-Shaped Student: A Video </h4>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AzOmnsVAlBA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h4> What is this video about? </h4>

<p> The V-shaped video was the third project assigned to us this semester in writing and digital media. For this assignment I worked in the same group as I did for the previous assignment, the T-shaped podcast. My group created a video that served to depict our understanding of the V-shaped student; the V-shaped student is a student who invests in life outside the classroom at Virginia Tech in addition to his or her academia. This is demonstrated in a number of ways: internships, study abroad programs, research, organizations, clubs and more. </p>

<p> In our video, we each contributed to the writing of the script and starred as one of the main characters in the storyline. This story is about Jimmy, a freshman English student who is struggling to understand the internship-hunting process, as well as what it means to get involved outside of classes. </p>

<p> Here, Jimmy is encouraged by his roommate and a Red Cross recruiter to build a resume, dress the part and explore his passions and interests outside the classroom. </p>

<p><i><b>A Poem for the VT-Shaped Student: "Storyteller"</b></i></p>

<p>cool metal rests between my finger tips
<p>and again I’m made aware of
<p>the weight of the pen in my hand,
<p>its metal body,
<p>and the path its smoothed away
	<p>.
<p>as it glides across the page
<p>I urge the fog inside my brain
<p>to rush away from this space,
<p>and my time with this page
	<p>.
<p>I tell the story of a girl I know well
<p>a girl with passion, a pen and
<p>eyes that grab at
<p>more than just a will to write
	<p>.
<p>but a deeply rooted desire
<p>more deeply rooted than the ink
<p>of the weighty pen’s ink that
<p>bled through the page
	<p>.
<p>she was a storyteller,
<p>a girl with a mission to save
<p>the lives of those who hadn’t had a story told
	<p>.
<p>she used a weighty pen
<p>much like the one I use today
<p>but much more than that she used technology to save
<p>those moments captured in her eyes
	<p>.
<p>she saw with lenses and with film
<p>she told  their stories online and
<p>steady-paced
	<p>.
<p>more than just a writer, she was a
<p>film maker,
<p>a journalist,
<p>a photographer by day—
<p>.
<p>she was a storyteller at her core
<p>at the root it mattered not what way
<p>and this is why I write
<p>I hope to tell stories like that storyteller some day

<p><i><b>A Poem for the VT-Shaped Student Explained ...</b></i></p>

<p> This poem about the VT-shaped student connects my identity and goals in digital media to the VT-shaped individual. Within this piece, I attempted to illustrate my passion for my work and my identity as an English student: a writer, poet, journalist, creative storyteller, 360-degree film maker and video producer. This poem exposes the parts of my life I’ve invested in digital media, online environments and other creative outlets. I’ve attempted to add an element of speculative design to this project by incorporating the free-flowing model of a poem (juxtaposed with the technical content) which is something I’m passionate about as a creative writer—and now, html coder.
