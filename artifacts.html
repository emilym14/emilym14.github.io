								<h3>In 500 words or less ... </h3>
								<p>What I found most compelling and interesting about this class was the transitional period we went through this month of building upon our coding skills within the time and structure of this Writing and Digital Media course. When we first began unit one, I—like many other students—felt very lost; I wasn’t quite sure what these foreign brackets and slashes were supposed to be creating, and at times, I felt like I wasn’t keeping up with the language.</p>
<p>The symbols we were using in HTML felt very foreign and confusing initially. I found it difficult to remember the ‘order of operations’ so to speak. I struggled specifically with recalling where and when to close certain codes and to let others overlap, which in turn, affected my coding abilities. Some pictures would not appear where I had attempted to insert them; some hyperlinks did not take me to pages I thought I had written them to send me to—and it was a bit frustrating at times.</p>
<p>However, as the unit progressed and the course called us to practice these coding skills more frequently and with more discipline, patterns started to form. Coding became more natural for me, and as a result, I enjoyed playing around with the patterns, fonts, colors and appearances of the web pages more genuinely. </p>
<p>A great example, I believe, of my improvement is this website that I have been able to create, code and reorganize as a part of my first major project in this course. I feel that it truly displays my capabilities of coding and my drive to ensure that the codes have been successfully written, committed and published. </p>
<p>It’s been really exciting and interesting to see how much more comfortable I feel now with coding, as an overarching whole, than I did just four short weeks ago. I now feel excited about the prospects of utilizing these digital writing skills to market myself to employers, display my own personal work online—in a more customizable manner, specific to my own taste—and to really explore the possibilities that come with the skillset of writing and publishing HTML code.</p>
<p>I would say that I definitely have a new-found respect for the work that digital writers execute. Coding in itself is a very large, somewhat vague job. There are many languages past what we’ve just begun to cover in this first unit and a lot of work that goes into making the sites we use every day come to life! I can’t imagine the time, planning and effort it takes to put into sites like Facebook, Instagram, online libraries and photo galleries—it’s an intricate process! I would love one day to be in a place where I feel I can contribute those same skills to website building and coding.</p>
<p>All in all, I have really enjoyed unit one, the skills we’ve built upon this month and the projects to come in the near future. I would love to build upon these skills further, to become more comfortable with CSS coding, and to eventually code websites with ease.</p>
